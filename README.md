# B&B_Chai_Cafe,
üöÄ
I'm eager to share my most recent project this weekend 20-07-2024 !!

I've finished a one Python project again that was developed for restaurant administration using Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and SQLite3 database.
üöÄ
## üçΩÔ∏è Key Features

- **Menu Management**: Cafe owners can easily add, update, and delete menu items.
  
- **Order Management**: During new orders, cafe owners can input customer names and mobile numbers, and select items from the menu. The system calculates and displays the total amount.

This project enhances efficiency and accuracy in managing restaurant operations. Looking forward to more such projects!
